# something-useful-for-medical-image-analysis
Try to share some experiences for medical image analysis.

Nowadays, there are lots of awesome materials for learning computer vision while not so much for medical applications. I bet everyone has heard of CVPR, NIPS, ICCV, ECCV. However, some top medical image conference like MICCAI, ISBI, IPMI are not well-known. Considering that healthcare should and would be a huge application for AI and some people may feel too hard to get in without sufficient study materials. I wrote this documents to try to share my experiences of doing medical image analysis. Hope it will help you guys!

## Top Conferences and Journals
One of the best way to learn things is learning from others, especially those excellent ones. The top conferences and journals are definitely the best way to study and follow the state-of-the-art techniques in some specific field.

As far as I know, MICCAI and ISBI are two main conferences in medical image analysis. MICCAI (International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention) is held every year in about October. It is about the biggest and most important conference in medical image field. You can regard it as the CVPR for those people doing medical image. Its accept rate is about 30%. For more details about MICCAI please refer to this document I wrote.

ISBI (IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging) is another important conference in this field, held every year in about April.

Other conferences I know are IPMI (International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging, biennial), FIMH (International Conference on Functional Imaging and Modeling of the Heart, biennial) and EMBC (International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society)
